# TODO application

This app is my Vue.js playground.

It's mostly standard TODO app - you can create, update, delete and tasks.
Less common features

- you also can order tasks (drag&drop)
- you can create multiple cards (task lists)

There is also integration with Firebase. It is used for:

- authorization backend
- database (firebase)

So you can (actually required) sign in and after that
all your data (lists and tasks) will be syncronized between all your devices.

This app is PWA, it means that you can install it to your browser
and use even when you are offline.
